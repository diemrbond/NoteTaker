# Note Taker

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)
## Description 
  This application is designed using expressjs and nodejs to allow a user to write, save and delete notes online from a JSON file. We needed to create the server, setup the routes and the API functionality. The front-end was designed already.

```
AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes
I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
